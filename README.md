Programming Assigments of Artificial Intelligence

THE1 is about uninformed searching methods,namely Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-first Search (DFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS).

THE2 is about implemantation of uninformed search methods with the TREE-SEARCH algorithm.

THE3 is about optimal decision-making in two-player games at the implementation level and provide hands-on experience with two algorithms (Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Search).

THE4 is about the Bayes Net.

THE5 is about Temporal Difference (TD) learning methods, Qlearning, and SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action).

THE6 is about the backpropagation algorithm (ANN).
